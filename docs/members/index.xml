The very idea of building DuoNB Alliance is hatched among Allen You, ZoomQuiet, and Chance Jiang, who have been product and tech pioneers in smart home, software engineering and connected products. Since 2019, they&amp;rsquo;ve been engaging more and more individual and organizational members, with their respective expertise and services, who&amp;rsquo;re committed to help each other along the DuoPlus Principles for connected product design.</description></item></channel></rss>
