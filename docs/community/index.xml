DuoNB Community Call is currently the primary activity moderated by community managers nominated from alliance members, to promote open sharing and discussion on the many aspects of business, products, technologies, and supply chain.
DuoNB Community Calls can be jointly hosted with other friendly communities, such as UIH - Unbuntu Innovation Hub (Foshan), and can be hosted as either virtual or in-person meetups or both.</description></item></channel></rss>
