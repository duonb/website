You agree that you will not use or register any trademark, service mark, business name, domain name or social media account name or handle which incorporates in whole or in part the DuoNB Marks or is similar to any of these.
2. ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT #2.1 Orders #You may order Services using our then-current ordering processes (\u0026ldquo;Order\u0026rdquo;).

Each Order shall be treated as a separate and independent Order.
2.2 Payment, Fees, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms #All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. You are responsible for providing accurate and current billing, contact and payment information to us. You agree that we may take steps to verify whether your payment method is valid, charge your payment card or bill you for all amounts due for your use of the Services. You agree that your credit card information and related personal data may be provided to third parties for payment processing and fraud prevention purposes. We may suspend or terminate your Services if at any time we determine that your payment information is inaccurate or not current, and you are responsible for fees and overdraft charges that we may incur when we charge your card for payment. You agree to pay all applicable, undisputed fees for the Services on the terms set forth on the invoice. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 below or in the Service Descriptions, any and all payments you make to us for access to the Services are final and non-refundable. An upgrade of your plan will immediately bill you. For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. DuoNB does not accept any liability for such loss. We reserve the right to update the price for Services at any time after your Initial Term, and price changes will be effective as of your next billing cycle. We will notify you of any price changes by publishing on our website, emailing, quoting or invoicing you.
2.3 Sales, Promotional Offers, Coupons and Pricing #Sales, promotions and other special discounted pricing offers are temporary and, upon the renewal of your subscription, any such discounted pricing offers may expire.

2.5 Taxes and Withholding #All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties. You are responsible for all applicable sales, services, value-added, goods and services, withholding, tariffs and similar taxes or fees (collectively, \u0026ldquo;Taxes and Fees\u0026rdquo;) imposed by any government entity or collecting agency based on the Services, except those Taxes and Fees based on our net income, or Taxes and Fees for which you have provided an exemption certificate. Additionally, if you do not satisfy your Tax and Fees obligations, you agree that you will be required to reimburse us for any Taxes and Fees paid on your behalf, and we may take steps to collect Taxes and Fees we have paid on your behalf. In all cases, you will pay the amounts due under this Agreement to us in full without any right of set-off or deduction.
3. TERM AND TERMINATION #3.1 Term #The initial term commitment for your purchase of Services will be as specified on an Order (\u0026ldquo;Initial Term\u0026rdquo;) and begins on the Effective Date. After the Initial Term, the Services will, unless otherwise specified in the Service Description for a particular Service, automatically renew for additional 12-month periods (\u0026ldquo;Renewal Terms\u0026rdquo;), unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the current term expires. You may provide notice of non-renewal for each Service you do not wish to renew at https://app.duonb.org. We may agree to align the invoicing under multiple Orders but this will not reduce the term of any Order. Terminating specific Services does not affect the term of any other Services still in effect. If we permit you to reinstate Services at any time after termination, you agree that you will be bound by the then-current Terms and the renewal date that was in effect as of the effective termination date.
3.2 Termination for Cause #Either party may terminate the Agreement (i) if the other party breaches its material obligations and fails to cure within 30 days of receipt of written notice, or (ii) if the other party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, liquidated or is dissolved, or ceases substantially all of its business, and we may suspend access or terminate immediately if you breach Section 1.2, 4 or 5.
3.3 Effect of Termination #If the Agreement or any Services are terminated, your account may be converted to a \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; version of the Service, if available, at our discretion. Otherwise, you will immediately discontinue all use of the terminated Services, except that upon request, we will provide you with limited access to the Services for a period not to exceed 30 days, solely to enable you to retrieve your Content (defined further below) from the Services. We have no obligation to maintain your Content after that period. Neither party will be liable for any damages resulting from termination of the Agreement, and termination will not affect any claim arising prior to the effective termination date. If we discontinue Services or materially reduce the core functionality in accordance with Section 1.3 above, the related Order will be terminated and we will provide you with a pro rata refund of any prepaid, unused fees. You agree to pay for any use of the Services past the date of expiration or termination which have not been converted to a free version of the Service.
3.4 Survival #The provisions of Sections 2 (Orders, Fees and Payment), 3.3 (Effect of Termination), 4 (Your Content and Accounts), 7 (Indemnification), 8 (Limitation on Liability), 9.6 (No Class Actions), 9.11 (Notices), and 9.14 (Contracting Party, Choice of Law and Location for Resolving Disputes) survive any termination of the Agreement.
