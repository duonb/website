As an early-stage tech alliance and community, DuoNB focuses on online calls and events on topics that can drive interests to potential product innovation by the [*DuoNB Principles.*]({{< ref "/#duoplus-principles" >}} "DuoPlus Principles")

DuoNB Community Call is currently the primary activity moderated by community managers nominated from alliance members, to promote open sharing and discussion on the many aspects of business, products, technologies, and supply chain.

DuoNB Community Calls can be jointly hosted with other friendly communities, such as UIH - Unbuntu Innovation Hub (Foshan), and can be hosted as either virtual or in-person meetups or both.

## Community Call How-to

We currently run the following types of community calls for DuoNB Alliance members and friends,

1. **DuoPlus Alliance Calls**, are on-demand calls from alliance members. We're boostrapping *DuoPlus Alliance* by building firstly one of its child-alliances, *[DuoNB Alliance](https://duonb.org)*.

2. **Project Team Calls**, such as DuoNB projects' team calls, are held weekly among project memebers.

3. **Project Community Calls**, is for a DuoNB project's community, a larger audience than dev team of the project, typically hosted once bi-weekly.

### Call apps we use
  * [Feishu.com](https://feishu.cn)/[Larksuite.com](https://larksuite.com)
  * [Zoom](https://zoom.us)

### Track and join calls/events/meetups

All meetups, calls or events are published on [Events](/events/) section of this website.

Except for alliance governance calls, which we'll record and publish the recording afterwards on this webiste, communities calls and all other types of calls or meetups, virtual or in-person, are on a propose-approval or request-approval basis by community members.

Currently, community calls for in Q1, 2022 are open for recommendation except those already scheduled here. Please send us your ideas or thoughts to info@duonb.org.
