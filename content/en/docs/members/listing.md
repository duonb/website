DuoNB Alliance is currently being boostrapped by a small but dedicated group of professionals.

The very idea of building DuoNB Alliance is hatched among Allen You, ZoomQuiet, and Chance Jiang, who have been product and tech pioneers in smart home, software engineering and connected products. Since 2019, they've been engaging more and more individual and organizational members, with their respective expertise and services, who're committed to help each other along the DuoPlus Principles for connected product design.

In less than two months after we decided to build the alliance in September 2021, we've gathered enough attention from China's core community of chip makers, networking tech firms and IoP (Internet of Production) tooling & service platforms.
