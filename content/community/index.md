As an early-stage tech alliance and community, DuoNB focuses on online calls and events on topics that can drive interests to potential product innovation by the [*DuoPlus Principles.*]({{< ref "/#duoplus-principles" >}} "DuoPlus Principles")

DuoNB Community Call is currently the primary activity moderated by community managers nominated from alliance members, to promote open sharing and discussion on the many aspects of business, products, technologies, and supply chain.

DuoNB Community Calls can be jointly hosted with other friendly communities, such as UIH - Unbuntu Innovation Hub (Foshan), and can be hosted as either virtual or in-person meetups or both.

## Community Calls

We currently run the following types of community calls for DuoNB Alliance members and friends,

1. **DuoPlus Alliance Calls**, are on-demand calls from alliance members. We're boostrapping *DuoPlus Alliance* by building firstly one of its child-alliances, *[DuoNB Alliance](https://duonb.org)*.

2. **Project Team Calls**, such as DuoNB projects' team calls, are held weekly among project memebers.

3. **Project Community Calls**, is for a DuoNB project's community, a larger audience than dev team of the project, typically hosted once bi-weekly.

### Call apps we use
